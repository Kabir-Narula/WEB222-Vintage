# RB MusicWebpage - Web 222 Final Assignment

Hey there! Welcome to RB MusicWebpage, my final assignment for the Web 222 course. I'm excited to take you on a tour of what I've built and share my journey in creating this music-centric webpage.

# Project Overview:
RB MusicWebpage is a simple yet stylish website designed to bring music enthusiasts closer to their favorite tunes. As part of my Web 222 final assignment, I wanted to create a platform that showcases my web development skills while catering to the musical interests of users.
Features and Functionality
RB MusicWebpage offers the following features:

Vintage Design with Modern Twists
The webpage is designed with vintage aesthetics, utilizing a color palette and typography reminiscent of the past. CSS styles have been applied to create a nostalgic atmosphere while maintaining a modern and engaging user experience.

Dynamic Artist Menu
The artist menu dynamically populates clickable artist names based on the "artists" array in the app.js file. When an artist is clicked, their information is displayed above a set of "cards," each representing a song by the selected artist.

Artist Information and Links
Upon clicking an artist's name, the artist's name and a comma-separated list of links are dynamically displayed in the "selected-artist" section. These links open in new windows, allowing users to explore more about the artist.

Song Cards
RB MusicWebpage utilizes "cards" to present song information. These cards display details such as song name, year, duration, and album image. The cards are dynamically generated based on the selected artist, providing a seamless browsing experience.

Custom Styling
The webpage includes custom CSS styling to position the cards, render album images, and enhance the overall visual appeal. The design is further enriched with a custom font, background color variations, and unique styles for external links.

Academic Integrity Statement
Please note that this project adheres to the principles of academic integrity. Any external resources used for inspiration or guidance have been appropriately cited, and the code has been developed independently as part of the Web 222 final assignment.
