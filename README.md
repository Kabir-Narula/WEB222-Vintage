## Project Overview

Welcome to the RB MusicWebpage! This project serves as a captivating tribute to R&B music artists, including Keshi, Niki, and the 1975. Combining vintage aesthetics with contemporary design, the webpage provides a unique and stylish way to explore and enjoy R&B music.

### Highlights

- Vintage-inspired design with modern touches.
- Dynamic artist menu for seamless navigation.
- Interactive song "cards" for a nostalgic experience.
- JavaScript functionality brings content to life.

## Design Philosophy: Nostalgia Meets Innovation

The design of RB MusicWebpage unites the sentiment of nostalgia with the innovation of modern design. Elements of the past and present coalesce to create an engaging user experience.

### Vintage CSS Elements

- **Color Palette:** Muted earthy tones and subtle gradients evoke nostalgia.
- **Typography:** Fonts like "Shadows Into Light" and "Courier New" impart handwritten and typewriter-inspired aesthetics.
- **Card Layout:** Song "cards" emulate trading cards with borders and colors reminiscent of classic album covers.
- **Album Images:** Images transform subtly on hover, capturing both old and new visual styles.

### Subtle Animations

- Song cards and album images respond with gentle hover animations, evoking the tactile experience of handling vinyl records.

## JavaScript Functionality: Bringing Content to Life

RB MusicWebpage is more than aesthetics; it's about dynamic content and interactivity.

### Dynamic Artist Menu

- The `buildMenu()` function generates an artist menu using data from the "artists" array, facilitating easy navigation through music categories.

### Interactive Artist Display

- The `showSelectedArtist(artistID)` function dynamically displays artist information and links upon selection, enriching the user experience with insights into their background.

### Nostalgic Song Cards

- The `showCardsByArtist(artistID)` function generates DOM updates to showcase song "cards" with details like name, year, duration, and album image. This encapsulates the experience of browsing vinyl records.

## CSS: Crafting an Immersive Experience

The CSS applied to RB MusicWebpage harmonizes with the design and functionality:

- **Background Pattern:** A vintage pattern adds depth, enriching the aesthetic appeal.
- **Navigation and Styling:** The navigation bar enables effortless artist exploration, with hover effects, custom fonts, and color transitions for an engaging experience.
- **Song Cards Styling:** Nostalgic song cards, reminiscent of trading cards and classic albums, feature shadows, animations, and colors to create an immersive browsing environment.
