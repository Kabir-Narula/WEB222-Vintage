# Project Overview:
RB MusicWebpage is a simple yet stylish website designed to bring music enthusiasts closer to their favorite tunes. As part of my Web 222 final assignment, I wanted to create a platform that showcases my web development skills while catering to the musical interests of users.
Features and Functionality
RB MusicWebpage offers the following features:

# Design: Vintage Aesthetics and Modern Flourish
The design of RB MusicWebpage is a harmonious fusion of vintage aesthetics and modern sensibilities. I aimed to capture the nostalgia of a bygone era while infusing it with contemporary design elements. The use of a vintage background pattern, reminiscent of ragged and aged paper, sets the tone for a journey into musical nostalgia.

Vintage CSS Elements
The design is rich with carefully crafted vintage CSS elements:

Color Palette: Muted earthy tones and warm hues evoke a sense of nostalgia, while subtle gradients add depth and elegance.

Typography: The choice of fonts, such as "Shadows Into Light" and "Courier New," imparts a handwritten and typewriter-inspired feel, amplifying the vintage charm.

Card Layout: The song "cards" embrace the essence of trading cards and vintage imagery. Each card is meticulously styled with borders, padding, and background colors reminiscent of classic album covers.

Album Images: Album images are integrated with a blend of nostalgic and modern styles, featuring a subtle yet captivating transformation upon hover.

Subtle Animations: Elements such as song cards and album images respond to user interactions with gentle hover animations, reminiscent of flipping through vinyl records.

# JavaScript Functionality
RB MusicWebpage is not just about aesthetics; it's also about dynamic content and interactive exploration. The JavaScript functionality brings life to the webpage:

## Artist Menu: The dynamic artist menu is generated using the buildMenu() function. It populates clickable artist names based on the "artists" array, allowing users to easily navigate through the music categories.

Selected Artist Display: The showSelectedArtist(artistID) function dynamically displays the artist's information and links when an artist is clicked. This feature enhances the user experience by providing insights into the artist's background.

Song Cards: The showCardsByArtist(artistID) function generates and updates the DOM to display song "cards" for the selected artist. Each card encapsulates song details, including name, year, duration, and album image.

CSS and Design Philosophy
The CSS applied to RB MusicWebpage complements the design and functionality in a seamless manner:

Background Pattern: The use of the vintage background pattern adds texture and depth to the webpage, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal.

Navigation and Styling: The navigation bar is thoughtfully designed, allowing users to seamlessly explore different artists. The use of hover effects, custom fonts, and color transitions contributes to a visually engaging experience.

Song Cards Styling: Song cards exhibit a nostalgic charm, reminiscent of trading cards and classic album covers. Subtle shadows, responsive animations, and carefully chosen colors create an immersive browsing experience.
